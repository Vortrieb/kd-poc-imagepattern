# BAER ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ

> "Dude, you spelled bear wrong. Or bare, not quite sure." - "Both; on purpose."

My Kickstart-Template for playing around with stuff. Contains just enough to get
going with most of what I'm currently dealing with. I usually add stuff like
ThreeJS, Processing, D3 or whatever with bower.

I can use this bare (pun intended) project to start frontend and nodejs
experiments.

## Contents

- Small Express-Server
- Mustache Template Enginge (via consolidate)
- Compass
- Autoprefixer
- Livereload
- CSSO (css compressor) 
- JS Uglifier
- Mocha Testrunner (with Chai.assert preconfigured)

## Getting Started

	git clone https://github.com/noxoc/baer somefolder
	cd somefolder
	./init.sh

From then on just `npm start` and start coding
